Spring Boot integration with GCP Big Query

## Spring Boot tutorial for integration with Big Query

In this video and code sample we will create a Big Query table and load this with a csv file for Flight Data.

We will then read this form a Spring Boot application accesing a Big Query.

We then also add data to the Big Query Data set using a Streaming API from within Java.

Using this method you can create Microservices to access Big Query results and also integrate into Java Eco system as needed.
